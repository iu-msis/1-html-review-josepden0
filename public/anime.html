      My Favorite Anime of All Time
      <p> Death Parade </p>
      <p> Plot: Whenever someone dies, they are sent to one of many mysterious bars run by bartenders serving as arbiters inside a tower in the afterlife. There, they must compete in Death Games with their souls on the line, the results of which reveal what secrets led them to their situation and what their fate will be afterwards, with the arbiters judging if their souls will either be sent for reincarnation or banished into the void. The series follows Decim, the lone bartender of the bar where people who died at the same time are sent to, known as the Quindecim bar, and his assistant. </p>
      <p> My Personal Opinion: This anime lives up to the psychological thriller genre. The art style is gorgeous and the cast of characters have wonderfully diverse thought processes, and this is exemplified on how they arbitrate on good vs. evil.</p>
